          <h2>Volleyball</h2>
          <p>
            Volleyball is not just a sport to me; it's a beloved hobby and a way
            of life. It's the rhythmic sound of the ball bouncing on the court,
            <br />
            the thrill of a well-executed spike, and the satisfying high-five
            after a well-fought match. My love for volleyball goes beyond the
            game itself; it's a source of joy and a true passion.

          <h2>Painting</h2>
          <p>
            Painting is a way to capture emotions and experiences that are often
            difficult to put into words. It's a means of storytelling without
            uttering a single sentence, <br />
            a visual diary of my life's journey. With each piece, I pour a piece
            of my soul onto the canvas, and the result is a reflection of my
            perspective, my moods, and my aspirations.
